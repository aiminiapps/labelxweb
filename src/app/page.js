// please update me current website component they are sucks in ui so you need to completely redesing and rebuild but follow the color theme of the component and else all things need to update so make it with latest aesthetics web 3 design with lots of tasteful and micro interactions animations as well and use the best icons form the react-icons and for animations use motion and for scrolling animations use the lenis library 'don't use the js deliver link use the library ' and also I will added the reference image and according to the refrence update the hero section and also project description 'LabelX is a Web3-powered platform that turns data labeling into a simple way to earn real crypto. The core idea is to connect everyday users with AI companies that need high‑quality labeled data, and to reward those users directly in the LBLX token for every task they complete. Instead of needing trading skills or large investments, people can earn by doing clear, guided micro‑tasks like tagging images, checking text, or verifying data, all from a clean, mobile‑friendly interface.

// The concept is to build a decentralized “AI workforce” where anyone with an internet connection and a wallet can contribute to training smarter models while keeping full control of their rewards. Tasks are priced transparently in LBLX, payouts are designed to be instant to the user’s wallet, and smart contracts handle the reward logic so there is no middleman deciding who gets paid or when. Over time, LabelX aims to layer in specialized AI agents, richer task types, and community features so that contributing to AI feels less like clicking for pennies and more like participating in a premium, gamified earning ecosystem tailored for the next generation of AI and crypto users.'
